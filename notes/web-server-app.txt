Using OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications

Spark icon
Page Summary
This document explains how web server applications use Google API Client Libraries or Google OAuth 2.0 endpoints to implement OAuth 2.0 authorization to access the YouTube Data API.

OAuth 2.0 allows users to share specific data with an application while keeping their usernames, passwords, and other information private. For example, an application can use OAuth 2.0 to obtain permission to upload videos to a user's YouTube channel.

This OAuth 2.0 flow is specifically for user authorization. It is designed for applications that can store confidential information and maintain state. A properly authorized web server application can access an API while the user interacts with the application or after the user has left the application.

Web server applications frequently also use service accounts to authorize API requests, particularly when calling Cloud APIs to access project-based data rather than user-specific data. Web server applications can use service accounts in conjunction with user authorization. Note that the YouTube Data API supports the service account flow only for YouTube content owners that own and manage multiple YouTube channels. Specifically, content owners can use service accounts to call API methods that support the onBehalfOfContentOwner request parameter.

Note: Given the security implications of getting the implementation correct, we strongly encourage you to use OAuth 2.0 libraries when interacting with Google's OAuth 2.0 endpoints. It is a best practice to use well-debugged code provided by others, and it will help you protect yourself and your users. For more information, see Client libraries.
Client libraries
The language-specific examples on this page use Google API Client Libraries to implement OAuth 2.0 authorization. To run the code samples, you must first install the client library for your language.

When you use a Google API Client Library to handle your application's OAuth 2.0 flow, the client library performs many actions that the application would otherwise need to handle on its own. For example, it determines when the application can use or refresh stored access tokens as well as when the application must reacquire consent. The client library also generates correct redirect URLs and helps to implement redirect handlers that exchange authorization codes for access tokens.

Google API Client Libraries for server-side applications are available for the following languages:

Go
Java
.NET
Node.js
Dart
PHP
Python
Ruby
Important: The Google API client library for JavaScript and Sign In With Google are only intended to handle OAuth 2.0 in the user's browser. If you want to use JavaScript on the server-side to manage OAuth 2.0 interactions with Google, consider using the Node.js library on your backend platform.
Prerequisites
Enable APIs for your project
Any application that calls Google APIs needs to enable those APIs in the API Console.

To enable an API for your project:

Open the API Library in the Google API Console.
If prompted, select a project, or create a new one.
Use the Library page to find and enable the YouTube Data API. Find any other APIs that your application will use and enable those, too.
Create authorization credentials
Any application that uses OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs must have authorization credentials that identify the application to Google's OAuth 2.0 server. The following steps explain how to create credentials for your project. Your applications can then use the credentials to access APIs that you have enabled for that project.

Go to the Clients page.
Click Create Client.
Select the Web application application type.
Fill in the form and click Create. Applications that use languages and frameworks like PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET must specify authorized redirect URIs. The redirect URIs are the endpoints to which the OAuth 2.0 server can send responses. These endpoints must adhere to Google’s validation rules.
For testing, you can specify URIs that refer to the local machine, such as http://localhost:8080. With that in mind, please note that all of the examples in this document use http://localhost:8080 as the redirect URI.

We recommend that you design your app's auth endpoints so that your application does not expose authorization codes to other resources on the page.

After creating your credentials, download the client_secret.json file from the API Console. Securely store the file in a location that only your application can access.

Important: Do not store the client_secret.json file in a publicly-accessible location. In addition, if you share the source code to your application — for example, on GitHub — store the client_secret.json file outside of your source tree to avoid inadvertently sharing your client credentials.
Your application's client secret will only be shown after you create the client. You won't be able to view or download the client secret again. Learn more .

Identify access scopes
Scopes enable your application to only request access to the resources that it needs while also enabling users to control the amount of access that they grant to your application. Thus, there may be an inverse relationship between the number of scopes requested and the likelihood of obtaining user consent.

Before you start implementing OAuth 2.0 authorization, we recommend that you identify the scopes that your app will need permission to access.

We also recommend that your application request access to authorization scopes via an incremental authorization process, in which your application requests access to user data in context. This best practice helps users to more easily understand why your application needs the access it is requesting.

The YouTube Data API v3 uses the following scopes:

Scope	Description
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube	Manage your YouTube account
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.channel-memberships.creator	See a list of your current active channel members, their current level, and when they became a member
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl	See, edit, and permanently delete your YouTube videos, ratings, comments and captions
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly	View your YouTube account
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload	Manage your YouTube videos
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtubepartner	View and manage your assets and associated content on YouTube
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtubepartner-channel-audit	View private information of your YouTube channel relevant during the audit process with a YouTube partner
The OAuth 2.0 API Scopes document contains a full list of scopes that you might use to access Google APIs.

If your public application uses scopes that permit access to certain user data, it must complete a verification process. If you see unverified app on the screen when testing your application, you must submit a verification request to remove it. Find out more about unverified apps and get answers to frequently asked questions about app verification in the Help Center.
Language-specific requirements
To run any of the code samples in this document, you'll need a Google account, access to the Internet, and a web browser. If you are using one of the API client libraries, also see the language-specific requirements below.

PHP
Python
Ruby
Node.js
HTTP/REST
To run the PHP code samples in this document, you'll need:

PHP 8.0 or greater with the command-line interface (CLI) and JSON extension installed.
The Composer dependency management tool.
The Google APIs Client Library for PHP:


composer require google/apiclient:^2.15.0
See Google APIs Client Library for PHP for more information.

Obtaining OAuth 2.0 access tokens
The following steps show how your application interacts with Google's OAuth 2.0 server to obtain a user's consent to perform an API request on the user's behalf. Your application must have that consent before it can execute a Google API request that requires user authorization.

The list below quickly summarizes these steps:

Your application identifies the permissions it needs.
Your application redirects the user to Google along with the list of requested permissions.
The user decides whether to grant the permissions to your application.
Your application finds out what the user decided.
If the user granted the requested permissions, your application retrieves tokens needed to make API requests on the user's behalf.
Step 1: Set authorization parameters
Your first step is to create the authorization request. That request sets parameters that identify your application and define the permissions that the user will be asked to grant to your application.

If you use a Google client library for OAuth 2.0 authentication and authorization, you create and configure an object that defines these parameters.
If you call the Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint directly, you'll generate a URL and set the parameters on that URL.
The tabs below define the supported authorization parameters for web server applications. The language-specific examples also show how to use a client library or authorization library to configure an object that sets those parameters.

PHP
Python
Ruby
Node.js
HTTP/REST
The following code snippet creates a Google\Client() object, which defines the parameters in the authorization request.

That object uses information from your client_secret.json file to identify your application. (See creating authorization credentials for more about that file.) The object also identifies the scopes that your application is requesting permission to access and the URL to your application's auth endpoint, which will handle the response from Google's OAuth 2.0 server. Finally, the code sets the optional access_type and include_granted_scopes parameters.

For example, this code requests offline access to manage a user's YouTube account:


use Google\Client;

$client = new Client();

// Required, call the setAuthConfig function to load authorization credentials from
// client_secret.json file.
$client->setAuthConfig('client_secret.json');

// Required, to set the scope value, call the addScope function
$client->addScope(GOOGLE_SERVICE_YOUTUBE::YOUTUBE_FORCE_SSL);

// Required, call the setRedirectUri function to specify a valid redirect URI for the
// provided client_id
$client->setRedirectUri('http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/oauth2callback.php');

// Recommended, offline access will give you both an access and refresh token so that
// your app can refresh the access token without user interaction.
$client->setAccessType('offline');

// Recommended, call the setState function. Using a state value can increase your assurance that
// an incoming connection is the result of an authentication request.
$client->setState($sample_passthrough_value);

// Optional, if your application knows which user is trying to authenticate, it can use this
// parameter to provide a hint to the Google Authentication Server.
$client->setLoginHint('hint@example.com');

// Optional, call the setPrompt function to set "consent" will prompt the user for consent
$client->setPrompt('consent');

// Optional, call the setIncludeGrantedScopes function with true to enable incremental
// authorization
$client->setIncludeGrantedScopes(true);
The Google authorization server supports the following query string parameters for web server applications:

Parameters
client_id	Required
The client ID for your application. You can find this value in the Cloud Console Clients page.

redirect_uri	Required
Determines where the API server redirects the user after the user completes the authorization flow. The value must exactly match one of the authorized redirect URIs for the OAuth 2.0 client, which you configured in your client's Cloud Console Clients page. If this value doesn't match an authorized redirect URI for the provided client_id you will get a redirect_uri_mismatch error.

Note that the http or https scheme, case, and trailing slash ('/') must all match.

response_type	Required
Determines whether the Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint returns an authorization code.

Set the parameter value to code for web server applications.

scope	Required
A space-delimited list of scopes that identify the resources that your application could access on the user's behalf. These values inform the consent screen that Google displays to the user.

Scopes enable your application to only request access to the resources that it needs while also enabling users to control the amount of access that they grant to your application. Thus, there is an inverse relationship between the number of scopes requested and the likelihood of obtaining user consent.

The YouTube Data API v3 uses the following scopes:

Scope	Description
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube	Manage your YouTube account
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.channel-memberships.creator	See a list of your current active channel members, their current level, and when they became a member
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl	See, edit, and permanently delete your YouTube videos, ratings, comments and captions
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly	View your YouTube account
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload	Manage your YouTube videos
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtubepartner	View and manage your assets and associated content on YouTube
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtubepartner-channel-audit	View private information of your YouTube channel relevant during the audit process with a YouTube partner
The OAuth 2.0 API Scopes document provides a full list of scopes that you might use to access Google APIs.

We recommend that your application request access to authorization scopes in context whenever possible. By requesting access to user data in context, using incremental authorization, you help users to understand why your application needs the access it is requesting.

access_type	Recommended
Indicates whether your application can refresh access tokens when the user is not present at the browser. Valid parameter values are online, which is the default value, and offline.

Set the value to offline if your application needs to refresh access tokens when the user is not present at the browser. This is the method of refreshing access tokens described later in this document. This value instructs the Google authorization server to return a refresh token and an access token the first time that your application exchanges an authorization code for tokens.

state	Recommended
Specifies any string value that your application uses to maintain state between your authorization request and the authorization server's response. The server returns the exact value that you send as a name=value pair in the URL query component (?) of the redirect_uri after the user consents to or denies your application's access request.

You can use this parameter for several purposes, such as directing the user to the correct resource in your application, sending nonces, and mitigating cross-site request forgery. Since your redirect_uri can be guessed, using a state value can increase your assurance that an incoming connection is the result of an authentication request. If you generate a random string or encode the hash of a cookie or another value that captures the client's state, you can validate the response to additionally ensure that the request and response originated in the same browser, providing protection against attacks such as cross-site request forgery. See the OpenID Connect documentation for an example of how to create and confirm a state token.

Important: The OAuth client must prevent CSRF as called out in the OAuth2 Specification . One way to achieve this is by using the state parameter to maintain state between your authorization request and the authorization server's response.
include_granted_scopes	Optional
Enables applications to use incremental authorization to request access to additional scopes in context. If you set this parameter's value to true and the authorization request is granted, then the new access token will also cover any scopes to which the user previously granted the application access. See the incremental authorization section for examples.

enable_granular_consent	Optional
Defaults to true. If set to false, more granular Google Account permissions will be disabled for OAuth client IDs created before 2019. No effect for newer OAuth client IDs, since more granular permissions is always enabled for them.

When Google enables granular permissions for an application, this parameter will no longer have any effect.

login_hint	Optional
If your application knows which user is trying to authenticate, it can use this parameter to provide a hint to the Google Authentication Server. The server uses the hint to simplify the login flow either by prefilling the email field in the sign-in form or by selecting the appropriate multi-login session.

Set the parameter value to an email address or sub identifier, which is equivalent to the user's Google ID.

prompt	Optional
A space-delimited, case-sensitive list of prompts to present the user. If you don't specify this parameter, the user will be prompted only the first time your project requests access. See Prompting re-consent for more information.

Possible values are:

none	Don't display any authentication or consent screens. Must not be specified with other values.
consent	Prompt the user for consent.
select_account	Prompt the user to select an account.
Step 2: Redirect to Google's OAuth 2.0 server
Redirect the user to Google's OAuth 2.0 server to initiate the authentication and authorization process. Typically, this occurs when your application first needs to access the user's data. In the case of incremental authorization, this step also occurs when your application first needs to access additional resources that it does not yet have permission to access.

PHP
Python
Ruby
Node.js
HTTP/REST
Generate a URL to request access from Google's OAuth 2.0 server:

$auth_url = $client->createAuthUrl();
Redirect the user to $auth_url:

header('Location: ' . filter_var($auth_url, FILTER_SANITIZE_URL));
Google's OAuth 2.0 server authenticates the user and obtains consent from the user for your application to access the requested scopes. The response is sent back to your application using the redirect URL you specified.

Step 3: Google prompts user for consent
In this step, the user decides whether to grant your application the requested access. At this stage, Google displays a consent window that shows the name of your application and the Google API services that it is requesting permission to access with the user's authorization credentials and a summary of the scopes of access to be granted. The user can then consent to grant access to one or more scopes requested by your application or refuse the request.

Your application doesn't need to do anything at this stage as it waits for the response from Google's OAuth 2.0 server indicating whether any access was granted. That response is explained in the following step.

Errors
Requests to Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint may display user-facing error messages instead of the expected authentication and authorization flows. Common error codes and suggested resolutions are:

admin_policy_enforced
The Google Account is unable to authorize one or more scopes requested due to the policies of their Google Workspace administrator. See the Google Workspace Admin help article Control which third-party & internal apps access Google Workspace data for more information about how an administrator may restrict access to all scopes or sensitive and restricted scopes until access is explicitly granted to your OAuth client ID.

disallowed_useragent
The authorization endpoint is displayed inside an embedded user-agent disallowed by Google's OAuth 2.0 Policies.

iOS and macOS developers may encounter this error when opening authorization requests in WKWebView. Developers should instead use iOS libraries such as Google Sign-In for iOS or OpenID Foundation's AppAuth for iOS.

Web developers may encounter this error when an iOS or macOS app opens a general web link in an embedded user-agent and a user navigates to Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint from your site. Developers should allow general links to open in the default link handler of the operating system, which includes both Universal Links handlers or the default browser app. The SFSafariViewController library is also a supported option.

org_internal
The OAuth client ID in the request is part of a project limiting access to Google Accounts in a specific Google Cloud Organization. For more information about this configuration option see the User type section in the Setting up your OAuth consent screen help article.

invalid_client
The OAuth client secret is incorrect. Review the OAuth client configuration, including the client ID and secret used for this request.

deleted_client
The OAuth client being used to make the request has been deleted. Deletion can happen manually or automatically in the case of unused clients . Deleted clients can be restored within 30 days of the deletion. Learn more .

invalid_grant
When refreshing an access token or using incremental authorization, the token may have expired or has been invalidated. Authenticate the user again and ask for user consent to obtain new tokens. If you are continuing to see this error, ensure that your application has been configured correctly and that you are using the correct tokens and parameters in your request. Otherwise, the user account may have been deleted or disabled.

redirect_uri_mismatch
The redirect_uri passed in the authorization request does not match an authorized redirect URI for the OAuth client ID. Review authorized redirect URIs in the Google Cloud Console Clients page.

The redirect_uri parameter may refer to the OAuth out-of-band (OOB) flow that has been deprecated and is no longer supported. Refer to the migration guide to update your integration.

invalid_request
There was something wrong with the request you made. This could be due to a number of reasons:

The request was not properly formatted
The request was missing required parameters
The request uses an authorization method that Google doesn't support. Verify your OAuth integration uses a recommended integration method
Step 4: Handle the OAuth 2.0 server response
Important: Before handling the OAuth 2.0 response on the server, you should confirm that the state received from Google matches the state sent in the authorization request. This verification helps to ensure that the user, not a malicious script, is making the request and reduces the risk of CSRF attacks.
The OAuth 2.0 server responds to your application's access request by using the URL specified in the request.

If the user approves the access request, then the response contains an authorization code. If the user does not approve the request, the response contains an error message. The authorization code or error message that is returned to the web server appears on the query string, as shown below:

An error response:


https://oauth2.example.com/auth?error=access_denied
An authorization code response:


https://oauth2.example.com/auth?code=4/P7q7W91a-oMsCeLvIaQm6bTrgtp7
Important: If your response endpoint renders an HTML page, any resources on that page will be able to see the authorization code in the URL. Scripts can read the URL directly, and the URL in the Referer HTTP header may be sent to any or all resources on the page.
Carefully consider whether you want to send authorization credentials to all resources on that page (especially third-party scripts such as social plugins and analytics). To avoid this issue, we recommend that the server first handle the request, then redirect to another URL that doesn't include the response parameters.

Sample OAuth 2.0 server response
You can test this flow by clicking on the following sample URL, which requests read-only access to view metadata for files in your Google Drive and read-only access to view your Google Calendar events:


https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
 scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fyoutube.readonly&
 access_type=offline&
 include_granted_scopes=true&
 state=state_parameter_passthrough_value&
 redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Foauth2callback&
 response_type=code&
 client_id=client_id
After completing the OAuth 2.0 flow, your browser redirects you to the OAuth 2.0 Playground, a tool for testing OAuth flows. You will see that the OAuth 2.0 Playground has automatically captured the authorization code.

Step 5: Exchange authorization code for refresh and access tokens
After the web server receives the authorization code, it can exchange the authorization code for an access token.

PHP
Python
Ruby
Node.js
HTTP/REST
To exchange an authorization code for an access token, use the fetchAccessTokenWithAuthCode method:


$access_token = $client->fetchAccessTokenWithAuthCode($_GET['code']);
Errors
When exchanging the authorization code for an access token you may encounter the following error instead of the expected response. Common error codes and suggested resolutions are listed below.

invalid_grant
The supplied authorization code is invalid or in the wrong format. Request a new code by restarting the OAuth process to prompt the user for consent again.

Step 6: Check which scopes users granted
When requesting multiple permissions (scopes), users may not grant your app access to all of them. Your app must verify which scopes were actually granted and gracefully handle situations where some permissions are denied, typically by disabling the features that rely on those denied scopes.

However, there are exceptions. Google Workspace Enterprise apps with domain-wide delegation of authority, or apps marked as Trusted, bypass the granular permissions consent screen. For these apps, users won't see the granular permission consent screen. Instead, your app will either receive all requested scopes or none.

For more detailed information, see How to handle granular permissions.

PHP
Python
Ruby
Node.js
HTTP/REST
To check which scopes the user has granted, use the getGrantedScope() method:


// Space-separated string of granted scopes if it exists, otherwise null.
$granted_scopes = $client->getOAuth2Service()->getGrantedScope();
Call Google APIs
PHP
Python
Ruby
Node.js
HTTP/REST
Use the access token to call Google APIs by completing the following steps:

If you need to apply an access token to a new Google\Client object — for example, if you stored the access token in a user session — use the setAccessToken method:

$client->setAccessToken($access_token);
Build a service object for the API that you want to call. You build a service object by providing an authorized Google\Client object to the constructor for the API you want to call. For example, to call the YouTube Data API:

$youtube = new Google_Service_YouTube($client);
Make requests to the API service using the interface provided by the service object. For example, to retrieve data about the authorized user's YouTube channel:

$channel = $youtube->channels->listChannels('snippet', array('mine' => $mine));
Complete example
The following example prints a JSON-formatted object showing information about a user's YouTube channel after the user authenticates and authorizes the application to manage the user's YouTube account.

PHP
Python
Ruby
Node.js
HTTP/REST
To run this example:

In the API Console, add the URL of the local machine to the list of redirect URLs. For example, add http://localhost:8080.
Create a new directory and change to it. For example:

mkdir ~/php-oauth2-example
cd ~/php-oauth2-example
Install the Google API Client Library for PHP using Composer:

composer require google/apiclient:^2.15.0
Create the files index.php and oauth2callback.php with the following content.
Run the example with the PHP's built-in test web server:

php -S localhost:8080 ~/php-oauth2-example
index.php

<?php
require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

session_start();

$client = new Google\Client();
$client->setAuthConfig('client_secret.json');

// User granted permission as an access token is in the session.
if (isset($_SESSION['access_token']) && $_SESSION['access_token'])
{
  $client->setAccessToken($_SESSION['access_token']);
  
  $youtube = new Google_Service_YouTube($client);
  $channel = $youtube->channels->listChannels('snippet', array('mine' => $mine));
  echo json_encode($channel);
  
}
else
{
  // Redirect users to outh2call.php which redirects users to Google OAuth 2.0
  $redirect_uri = 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/oauth2callback.php';
  header('Location: ' . filter_var($redirect_uri, FILTER_SANITIZE_URL));

  $state = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));
  $client->setState($state);
  $_SESSION['state'] = $state;

  $auth_url = $client->createAuthUrl();
  header('Location: ' . filter_var($auth_url, FILTER_SANITIZE_URL));

    die('State mismatch. Possible CSRF attack.');
  }

  // Get access and refresh tokens (if access_type is offline)
  $token = $client->fetchAccessTokenWithAuthCode($_GET['code']);

  /** Save access and refresh token to the session variables.
    * ACTION ITEM: In a production app, you likely want to save the
    *              refresh token in a secure persistent storage instead. */
  $_SESSION['access_token'] = $token;
  $_SESSION['refresh_token'] = $client->getRefreshToken();
  
  $redirect_uri = 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/';
  header('Location: ' . filter_var($redirect_uri, FILTER_SANITIZE_URL));
}

// An error response e.g. error=access_denied
if (isset($_GET['error']))
{
  echo "Error: ". $_GET['error'];
}
?>
Redirect URI validation rules
Google applies the following validation rules to redirect URIs in order to help developers keep their applications secure. Your redirect URIs must adhere to these rules. See RFC 3986 section 3 for the definition of domain, host, path, query, scheme and userinfo, mentioned below.

Validation rules
Scheme	
Redirect URIs must use the HTTPS scheme, not plain HTTP. Localhost URIs (including localhost IP address URIs) are exempt from this rule.

Host	
Hosts cannot be raw IP addresses. Localhost IP addresses are exempted from this rule.

Domain	
Host TLDs (Top Level Domains) must belong to the public suffix list.
Host domains cannot be “googleusercontent.com”.
Redirect URIs cannot contain URL shortener domains (e.g. goo.gl) unless the app owns the domain. Furthermore, if an app that owns a shortener domain chooses to redirect to that domain, that redirect URI must either contain “/google-callback/” in its path or end with “/google-callback”.
Userinfo	
Redirect URIs cannot contain the userinfo subcomponent.

Path	
Redirect URIs cannot contain a path traversal (also called directory backtracking), which is represented by an “/..” or “\..” or their URL encoding.

Query	
Redirect URIs cannot contain open redirects.

Fragment	
Redirect URIs cannot contain the fragment component.

Characters	Redirect URIs cannot contain certain characters including:
Wildcard characters ('*')
Non-printable ASCII characters
Invalid percent encodings (any percent encoding that does not follow URL-encoding form of a percent sign followed by two hexadecimal digits)
Null characters (an encoded NULL character, e.g., %00, %C0%80)
Incremental authorization
In the OAuth 2.0 protocol, your app requests authorization to access resources, which are identified by scopes. It is considered a best user-experience practice to request authorization for resources at the time you need them. To enable that practice, Google's authorization server supports incremental authorization. This feature lets you request scopes as they are needed and, if the user grants permission for the new scope, returns an authorization code that may be exchanged for a token containing all scopes the user has granted the project.

For example, suppose an app helps users identify interesting local events. The app lets users view videos about the events, rate the videos, and add the videos to playlists. Users can also use the app to add events to their Google Calendars.

In this case, at sign-in time, the app might not need or request access to any scopes. However, if the user tried to rate a video, add a video to a playlist, or perform another YouTube action, the app could request access to the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl scope. Similarly, the app could request access to the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar scope if the user tried to add a calendar event.

To implement incremental authorization, you complete the normal flow for requesting an access token but make sure that the authorization request includes previously granted scopes. This approach allows your app to avoid having to manage multiple access tokens.

The following rules apply to an access token obtained from an incremental authorization:

The token can be used to access resources corresponding to any of the scopes rolled into the new, combined authorization.
When you use the refresh token for the combined authorization to obtain an access token, the access token represents the combined authorization and can be used for any of the scope values included in the response.
The combined authorization includes all scopes that the user granted to the API project even if the grants were requested from different clients. For example, if a user granted access to one scope using an application's desktop client and then granted another scope to the same application via a mobile client, the combined authorization would include both scopes.
If you revoke a token that represents a combined authorization, access to all of that authorization's scopes on behalf of the associated user are revoked simultaneously.
Caution: choosing to include granted scopes will automatically add scopes previously granted by the user to your authorization request. A warning or error page may be displayed if your app is not currently approved to request all scopes that may be returned in the response. See Unverified apps for more information.
The language-specific code samples in Step 1: Set authorization parameters and the sample HTTP/REST redirect URL in Step 2: Redirect to Google's OAuth 2.0 server all use incremental authorization. The code samples below also show the code that you need to add to use incremental authorization.

Refreshing an access token (offline access)
Access tokens periodically expire and become invalid credentials for a related API request. You can refresh an access token without prompting the user for permission (including when the user is not present) if you requested offline access to the scopes associated with the token.

If you use a Google API Client Library, the client object refreshes the access token as needed as long as you configure that object for offline access.
If you are not using a client library, you need to set the access_type HTTP query parameter to offline when redirecting the user to Google's OAuth 2.0 server. In that case, Google's authorization server returns a refresh token when you exchange an authorization code for an access token. Then, if the access token expires (or at any other time), you can use a refresh token to obtain a new access token.
Requesting offline access is a requirement for any application that needs to access a Google API when the user is not present. For example, an app that performs backup services or executes actions at predetermined times needs to be able to refresh its access token when the user is not present. The default style of access is called online.

Server-side web applications, installed applications, and devices all obtain refresh tokens during the authorization process. Refresh tokens are not typically used in client-side (JavaScript) web applications.

If your application needs offline access to a Google API, set the API client's access type to offline:

$client->setAccessType("offline");
After a user grants offline access to the requested scopes, you can continue to use the API client to access Google APIs on the user's behalf when the user is offline. The client object will refresh the access token as needed.

Token revocation
In some cases a user may wish to revoke access given to an application. A user can revoke access by visiting Account Settings. See the Remove site or app access section of the Third-party sites & apps with access to your account support document for more information.

It is also possible for an application to programmatically revoke the access given to it. Programmatic revocation is important in instances where a user unsubscribes, removes an application, or the API resources required by an app have significantly changed. In other words, part of the removal process can include an API request to ensure the permissions previously granted to the application are removed.

To programmatically revoke a token, call revokeToken():


$client->revokeToken();
Key Point: Revocation removes all OAuth 2.0 scopes previously granted to a project, invalidating any issued access or refresh tokens for all clients registered under that project.
Note: Following a successful revocation response, it might take some time before the revocation has full effect.
Time-based access
Time-based access allows a user to grant your app access to their data for a limited duration to complete an action. Time-based access is available in select Google products during the consent flow, giving users the option to grant access for a limited period of time. An example is the Data Portability API which enables a one-time transfer of data.

When a user grants your application time-based access, the refresh token will expire after the specified duration. Note that refresh tokens may be invalidated earlier under specific circumstances; see these cases for details. The refresh_token_expires_in field returned in the authorization code exchange response represents the time remaining until the refresh token expires in such cases.

Implementing Cross-Account Protection
An additional step you should take to protect your users' accounts is implementing Cross-Account Protection by utilizing Google's Cross-Account Protection Service. This service lets you subscribe to security event notifications which provide information to your application about major changes to the user account. You can then use the information to take action depending on how you decide to respond to events.

Some examples of the event types sent to your app by Google's Cross-Account Protection Service are:

https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/sessions-revoked
https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/oauth/event-type/token-revoked
https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/account-disabled
See the Protect user accounts with Cross-Account Protection page for more information on how to implement Cross Account Protection and for the full list of available events.
